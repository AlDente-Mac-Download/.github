## What is AlDente for Mac?  

AlDente is an innovative battery optimization utility designed specifically for macOS that revolutionizes how you manage your MacBook's battery health. Unlike Apple's basic battery management system, AlDente provides granular control over charging behavior, allowing users to set custom charge limits between 20-100% to significantly extend battery lifespan.  

This powerful tool is particularly valuable for users who frequently work with their MacBooks plugged in for extended periods, as it prevents the common issue of battery degradation caused by continuous 100% charging. AlDente works seamlessly in the background, monitoring your battery status while consuming minimal system resources.  

The application features an intuitive interface with real-time battery statistics, including current charge level, cycle count, and temperature monitoring. Advanced users can access additional pro features like discharge mode, which helps calibrate battery sensors, and sailing mode that maintains optimal charge levels.  

For creative professionals, developers, and anyone who relies on their MacBook for daily work, AlDente offers peace of mind by preserving battery health and maintaining peak performance over years of use. The tool is compatible with all Intel and Apple Silicon MacBooks running modern versions of macOS.
